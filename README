These Ruby programs and scripts were created during the 29th batch of the RubyLearning course at RubyLearning.org.  We went through nearly all subjects covered in the standard Ruby reference, the 'pickaxe', by Dave Thomas.  Individual programs are not separate from one another but are typically only 1-3 files that are easily distinguished.  I loved my experience at RubyLearning and recommend the course as a first stop for anyone that wants to learn the language.
